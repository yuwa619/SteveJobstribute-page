            <h3>Who Was Steve Jobs?</h3>
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and
            chairman of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as
            dictating the evolution of modern technology. <br>
            Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but
            directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve
            Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a
            decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.</p>

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. He lived with his adoptive family in Mountain View,
            California, within the area that would later become known as Silicon Valley. <br>
            As a boy, Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family garage. Paul showed his son
            how to take apart and reconstruct electronics, a hobby that instilled confidence, tenacity and
            mechanical prowess in young Jobs.</p>

            <h3>Steve Jobs’ Education and College</h3>
            <p>Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, his youth was riddled with frustrations over formal
            schooling. Jobs was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to
            study. Jobs tested so well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high school — a proposal that his
            parents declined. <br>
            After high school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Lacking direction, he dropped out of college after
            six months and spent the next 18 months dropping in on creative classes at the school. Jobs later recounted how one
            course in calligraphy developed his love of typography.
            <br>
            In 1974, Jobs took a position as a video game designer with Atari. Several months later he left the company to find
            spiritual enlightenment in India, traveling further and experimenting with psychedelic drugs.</p>
